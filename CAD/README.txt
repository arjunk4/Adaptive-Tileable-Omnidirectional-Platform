1. Terminology and brief functionality
    a. Bearings/ Bushings
        Gear Bearings: 3x8x4 bearings that allow rotation of drive transmission gears and direction gears that are not directly connected to motors.
        Drive Bearing/ Bushing: Allows independent rotation of the top inner stage and disk.
        Direction Bearing/ Bushing: Mounting point for the inner stages, allowing for their rotation in the support plate.
	Skateboard Bearings: 8x22x7 bearings that allow rotation of drive gears in the drive gear support.
    b. Couplers
        Drive Couplers: Couples rotation of the drive motor and the drive transmission gear.
        Direction Coupler: Couples rotation of the direction motor and the direction gear.
    c. Disk: Main end-effector for the treadmill.
    d. Drive Gear Support: Positive reinforcement for the drive gears and their bearings. It is built as a part of the substructure, and can be detached for easier assembly and disassembly.
    e. Gears
        Drive Gear: Transmits rotation/ torque to the U-joints, from the drive transmission gear.
        Drive Transmission Gear: Transmits rotation/ torque from the drive motor to the drive gear.
        Direction Gear: Transmits rotation/ torque from the direction motor to the top inner stage.
    f. Inner Stage
        Top inner stage: Responsible for precession of the drive bearing, which causes precession of disk and U joint. Has a gear profile embedded, that receives torque from the direction
	gear.
        Bottom inner stage: Responsible for clamping the top inner stage to the direction bearing, to avoid possibilities of it getting detached during operation.
    g. Motors
        Drive Motor: Prime mover for speed control.
        Direction Motor: Prime mover for direction control.
    h. Substructure: Main load transmitting element from the top of the platform to ground. It is divided into two stages (upper & lower), with the upper having motor mounts.
    i. Support Plate: Mounting point for all direction bearings and gear bearings.
    j. U-joint: Accommodates for the 10 degree misalignment between the shaft of the disk and the drive gear.


2. File naming convention
For the most part, files are named as: description_vx (where x is the version number). Always use lowercase letters to avoid issues with case sensitivity and simplify typing in the terminal. Folder names start with an upper case.
