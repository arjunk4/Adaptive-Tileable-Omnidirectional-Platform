Paper extraction:

1) Peak VGRF in amputees: 
1.5 BW on sound limb, 1 BW on prosthetic

2) Peak V impulse in amputees:
0.8 BWsec on sound limb, 0.6 BWsec on prosthetic

3) Level and incline running wiki page:
One complete gait cycle is defined as beginning when one foot comes into contact with the ground and continuing until that same foot contacts the ground again
Running, by definition, involves a maximum of one foot in contact with the ground at any given time and often no contact with the ground.
One complete gait cycle involves a stance and swing phase for each leg.
Gave me reference to paper on GRF in incline running

4) VGRF in incline running:
3, 6 and 9 degree inclines (uphill and downhill)
Downhill: -9 -> 2.6 BW, -6 -> 2.5 BW, -3 -> 2.3 BW
Uphill: -9, -6, -3 -> 2.2 BW
Level: 2.4 BW

5) HGRF in incline running:
3, 6 and 9 degree inclines (uphill and downhill)
Downhill: -9 -> 0.6 BW, -6 -> 0.5 BW, -3 -> 0.4 BW
Uphill: +9 -> 0.6 BW, +6 -> 0.5 BW, +3 -> 0.4 BW
Level: +- 0.3 BW

5) Stride frequency in running (uphill, downhill, level)
1.41 to 1.58 Hz

6) VGRF in dominant limb in bilateral jump landing:
1.1m - 5.3 BW, 0.6m - 3 BW, 0.3m - 2.5 BW

7) V impulse in dominant limb in bilateral landing:
1.1m - 0.005 Ns/kg, 0.6m - 0.001 Ns/kg, 0.3m - 0.0005 Ns/kg

8) Params like GRF and DLFs are frequency dependent

9) Monitoring the C7th vertebrae at the base of the neck is appropriate for recording GRFs upto a frequency of 4Hz for bobbing and 5Hz for jumping (it is equivalent to a COM)

10) Bobbing is commonly known to excite resonant frequencies in structures, with jouncing being more frequent

11) Normalized avg peak force in Jumping as a function of frequency:
1Hz - 3.3 BW, 2Hz - 4 BW, 3Hz - 3.4 BW

12) Normalized avg peak force in Bobbing as a function of frequency:
1Hz - 1.9 BW, 2Hz - 2.4 BW, 3Hz - 2.6 BW, 4Hz - 2.1 BW

13) Dynamic loading factor values at the harmonic frequencies of jumping:
At 1Hz excitation frequency -> Jumping has highest DLF in 2Hz harmonic freq (1.2), Bobbing has highest DLF in 3Hz harmonic freq (0.4)
At 2Hz excitation freq -> Jumping has highest in 2Hz harm freq (1.6), Bobbing has highest in 2Hz harm freq (1.1)
At 3Hz excitation freq -> Jumping has highest in 3Hz harm freq (1.6), Bobbing has highest in 3Hz (1.1)
At 4Hz excitation -> Bobbing has highest in 3.5Hz harm freq (1.2)

14) Peak forces vs contact ratio (contact time/ period of jumping) in jumping (given at 1Hz and 2 Hz):
some example values: 4.3 BW at 0.43, 3.8 BW at 0.65, 2.8 BW at 0.85

15) Peak acceleration at natural frequencies of the floor during jumping and bobbing:
1.5m/s^2 at 1Hz, 6 m/s^2 at 2Hz and 3Hz, 3m/s^2 at 4Hz and 5.5Hz, drops off after this (jumping)
1.5m/s^2 at 1Hz, 3.5 m/s^2 at 2Hz, 4m/s^2 at 3Hz, 3m/s^2 at 4Hz, drops off after this (bobbing)
The modal mass was taken as 10,000kg (quite low in reality, which is around 35,000 kg)

16) Taking a walking speed of 1.25 m/s, the VGRF and HGRFs are:
VGRF: 1.3 BW
APGRF: 0.22 BW
MLGRF: 0.1 BW

17) For slow, preferred and fast running speeds, the VGRF is:
HS runners -> Slow (3.33 m/s) - 2.8 BW, Preferred (3.9 m/s) - 3 BW, Fast (4.4 m/s) - 3.2 BW
NHS runners -> Slow (3.33 m/s) - 2.7 BW, Preferred (3.9 m/s) - 2.8 BW, Fast (4.4 m/s) - 3 BW
There is also a table in this paper detailing the results specific to contact time, and time from heelstrike to toe-off (Table 3)

18) VGRF and HGRF in unilateral landing from a 10.5cm high box:
VGRF: 24.3 N/kg
Posterior GRF: 6.2 N/kg

19) GRFs during turning 90 degrees at self-selected walking speeds:
MLGRF at Apex phase of turn: 3 N/kg (lateral)
APGRF at Apex phase of turn: 3 N/kg (anterior or posterior)
Apex phase is the one with max GRF and impulse

20) Impulses during turning 90 degrees at self-selected walking speeds:
MLI at Apex phase of turn: 160 SI
API at Apex phase of turn: 80 SI
